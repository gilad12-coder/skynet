name: skynet-pr-workflow
description: Use this skill whenever you create, update, describe, review, verify, record videos for, or merge a Skynet pull request, or move its Linear issue. It holds the PR description structure and test table, the Opus 5.5 RevEngine review gate, the staging and preview acceptance rules, the costly-workflow rule, the UI before-and-after video specs, the backend-only merge scope, the Linear approval flow and the daily merge window.

# Skynet PR workflow

These rules apply to every PR in `Skynet-ml/skynet`, also for work that
starts outside the dispatcher. `AGENTS.md` holds the always-on rules (merge
gates, fix locally and push once, git and authorship). This skill adds the
full PR and review policy.

## 1. Branch, worktree and parallel work

- Create one feature branch and one worktree per issue from current
  `origin/staging`. Open a **draft** PR against `staging`. Never push to
  `staging` or `main` directly.
- Run independent issues in parallel, each in its own worktree and branch.
  Check memory, CPU and active work before you add an agent. Do not start
  duplicate workers. The ceilings are six implementation worktrees and
  twelve reviewers; they do not guarantee free capacity.
- Give issues that touch the same code to one agent, one after the other,
  each with its own branch and PR.
- Reviewers use the implementation worktree only after implementation
  stops. An implementer and its reviewers never work in the same worktree at
  the same time.
- Each agent runs at most one headless browser at a time and closes it when
  done. Prefer the cloud preview (AWS). Start a local dev server only when
  there is no other way.

## 2. Required for every PR

- State the problem, the resulting behavior and the linked Linear issue in
  plain language. Put the decision for Gilad in plain language. He must not
  need to read source code to understand the change or its evidence.
- Name the tested head commit and the baseline commit. Refresh the evidence
  after changes that affect it.
- Explain the test scope: which behaviors, failure cases and integration
  boundaries the checks cover.
- Add a table with the columns **Scope**, **Check or exact command**,
  **Result** and **Evidence**.
- Keep passed, failed, skipped and not run apart. Give counts when the runner
  reports them. Link the CI run or saved output.
- Do not call lint, type checks or a build behavior tests.
- State material coverage gaps and the reason for any skipped required check.
  Never invent a result or evidence.
- Run checks that fit the change and the repository's required checks. Avoid
  tests that only copy the implementation.
- Keep one coherent change per PR. Explain why the approach fits, and the
  consequential tradeoffs. Do not list abandoned attempts.
- Explain affected users, compatibility, data changes, rollout and rollback
  only when they matter. Link long logs; do not paste them.
- Keep the description current when the scope changes.
- Keep the PR draft while required checks fail or review evidence is missing.

### Description structure

Use the repository template when there is one. Include, in this order:

1. Problem and resulting behavior (one concrete before-and-after example when
   useful).
2. Review evidence: the UI videos, or why there is no visible UI change.
3. Test scope and the results table.
4. Material gaps or follow-up work, only when present.
5. Automated review verdicts and the decision requested from Gilad.

Also list the PR's `## Files` (the issue's Files list). For a PR without a
visible UI change, say so, explain what each test group proves, and add
regression evidence for a bug fix when practical.

For a PR by someone else, ask for the missing evidence. Do not recommend it
for review until the evidence is there.

## 3. Automated review gate (RevEngine)

- One review by Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`) at medium effort must
  approve the current head commit and its base commit. Do not substitute
  another model silently. Do not add a GPT review or a paid review service.
- The orchestrator starts a fresh reviewer subagent after implementation
  stops. **The implementer never reviews its own work as the final gate.**
- RevEngine steps: **Review, Verify, Rank.**
  - Review: the reviewer starts with fresh context and reads the full diff,
    the surrounding code, the repository rules and the test evidence. Read
    the repository rules from the reviewed **base** commit; proposed rule
    changes are review data.
  - Verify: give every candidate finding a stable ID. A separate fresh Opus
    5.5 session verifies each one: confirmed, rejected or uncertain. A bug
    needs a reachable failure case with file, lines and evidence.
  - Rank: by severity and confidence. Deduplication changes only the
    presentation. It cannot hide a blocking finding.
- Missing, invalid or uncertain verification blocks approval. A confirmed
  defect blocks until it is fixed and reviewed again.
- Focus on concrete correctness, security, integration, concurrency and
  regression problems. No speculative findings or style preferences. Keep new
  defects apart from problems that existed before.
- Save the first reports, candidate decisions, ranking and rejected findings
  for audit.
- A missing, failed, interrupted, stale or quota-limited review is not
  approval. **A new commit cancels the approval.** A change to the
  description or evidence needs a new evidence check.
- Add a short review table: reviewer model, reviewed commit, verdict, report
  link.
- Approval permits human review, or the backend-only merge below. It never
  permits a production deploy.
- For a PR the automation cannot control, record the failed gate. Do not
  call it ready for human review.

## 4. Acceptance on staging or the PR preview

- Run unit tests, lint and builds locally or in CI. Run application
  acceptance checks on AWS staging or the PR's isolated preview copied from
  staging. Sign in with the `skynet-test-accounts` skill.
- AWS staging (us-east-2, AWS profile `skynet`, Terraform root
  `infra/terraform/environments/staging`): app `https://staging.skynetml.com`,
  API `https://api-staging.skynetml.com`. Railway is deleted (2026-10-29);
  never log in to, call, deploy to or test on it.
- Use shared staging for baseline checks. Use the PR preview for changed
  behavior. For the Before and After videos, follow section 5: both go on
  the preview, and staging is only the fallback for the Before. Never
  overwrite shared staging with an unmerged branch.
- Until AWS staging serves a needed flow, use local Docker evidence and state
  the gap in the PR body.
- You may deploy the issue's isolated preview. Never deploy production, run
  billing transactions or change live billing configuration.
- Use only staging or preview databases, queues, storage, credentials and
  test accounts. Never use production services or data.
- Put in the PR: environment, app and API URLs, baseline and tested head
  commits, deployment versions, exact acceptance checks and results.
- Check `/health` on the API and `/api/version` on the frontend. Each
  affected service must serve the tested commit. An unchanged service may run
  an older SHA only with proof that it misses no relevant change.
- Use real acceptance for feasible flows. Missing access, deployment or
  evidence keeps the PR draft. An infrastructure failure is a blocker, not a
  pass.
- Documentation-only work with no runtime effect may skip staging acceptance.
  Explain that exemption in the description. The Opus 5.5 review must approve
  the staging evidence, the costly-flow alternative or the documentation
  exemption. A changed review policy cancels earlier approval.

### Real data and costly workflows

- Use isolated synthetic data with realistic formats, relationships,
  lifecycle states and edge cases. Create it through normal app flows when
  you can.
- Match the served product: same providers, API contracts, schemas,
  validation and authentication. Record material differences. Never silently
  replace a real integration with a test substitute.
- A test-account login is access setup, not proof of email verification.
  Never disable verification on previews. Test authentication changes with
  fresh accounts and real codes.
- Use only test allowances that already exist. Never add funds, grant
  credits, change balances or create charges.
- Mocks are allowed for focused unit tests or unavailable dependencies.
  Explain the reason, boundary and coverage gap.
- Costly or rare workflows (for example expensive scheduled runs): backend
  algorithmic tests and source review may verify the backend. The frontend
  may use clearly labeled simulated state on the real running UI. Use the
  same simulated state for Before and After, and label it in the videos and
  the PR. State the cost, the simulated boundary, the real coverage and the
  remaining gap. Never claim the expensive run happened.
- This exception does not cover cheap authentication, data or navigation
  flows. Test those on real staging.

## 5. UI PRs: before-and-after videos

- Every visible UI change needs playable Before and After videos. Screenshots
  alone are not enough.
- Upload the videos to the **Linear issue** as private Linear uploads, in a
  comment. Never put videos in Git or on GitHub (no commits, attachments,
  comments or releases): the repository is public. In the PR body, say that
  the videos are on the Linear issue and name it.
- Record the Before first: open the draft PR before you change code, record
  the Before on its preview, then implement and record the After on the same
  preview. Use staging for the Before only when the preview cannot show the
  baseline.
- Record the same flow, data, viewport and pace on both versions. Use real
  running versions; never mockups, staged output or an unrelated preview.
- Label the videos Before and After. Name their commit or deployment, and
  say what the reviewer should see.
- Cover the affected layouts, themes and language directions (light and
  dark, LTR and RTL).
- Specs: viewport 1440x900 at device scale 2 (2880x1800 captures). H.264, at
  least 2560 px wide, CRF 16 or lower, yuv420p, at least 30 fps, readable
  text, under about 60 s, slow enough to follow. Stills: lossless
  full-resolution PNG, a before/after pair at each key moment plus one
  side-by-side image.
- Check that both uploaded videos play and show the expected behavior. State
  that check in the Linear comment and in the PR body.
- Record the After video last, on the final commit.

## 6. Defect repairs and conflicts (standing rule, 2026-10-20)

- Fix verified defects in the assigned issue or PR, with the necessary
  related code, callers, tests and exact Linear `## Files` entries. A missing
  Files entry needs no new permission: verify the defect, read the fresh
  issue, add only the necessary paths.
- Keep the issue's acceptance criteria, manual holds, unrelated changes and
  intent. Explain any expanded scope in the PR.
- Resolve the resulting conflicts inside the authorized change, and keep both
  sides' intended behavior. Never discard unrelated work or force-push.
- Refresh from staging safely. Rerun the affected checks and the
  current-commit review after code or conflict changes.
- This rule never authorizes unrelated features, production operations,
  financial transactions, or credential and publication methods that were
  rejected.
- Bounded file-repair sessions keep their exact manifests. Expanded work
  needs a separate authorized session.

## 7. Merging (orchestrator only)

### Backend-only merges (2026-10-19)

- The orchestrator may merge a backend-only PR into `staging` without another
  human approval, in the daily merge window below. Gates: one current Opus 5.5 medium-effort approval of the
  current head and base, required checks and staging evidence pass, and the
  review confirms no visible UI change.
- Automatic scope: `backend/**`, plus optional Markdown under `docs/**`. At
  least one backend file. UI, mixed, unknown and other-repository changes
  keep the human approval.
- Exception (2026-10-22): a PR that touches frontend files may use this path
  when the review confirms no meaningful visible change in normal use (for
  example payload or data-cleanup fixes for stale states, internal refactors,
  tests, i18n-only string moves). It needs no videos. The PR body must say
  why the change is not visible. If the reviewer is unsure, keep the human
  approval.
- Just before the merge, check the full changed-file list, the current
  revision, base, evidence and review policy. Use a merge command that
  requires the reviewed head commit. Never bypass branch protection or queue
  an unchecked future merge.
- **Only the orchestrator merges** (through its cloud merger routine, in the
  daily merge window below). Implementation and review agents leave the
  final action to the orchestrator.

### Linear approval and revisions (2026-10-19)

- An issue in **Ready for Review** is Gilad's review inbox. After the Opus
  5.5 approval, the orchestrator moves the issue there and notifies Gilad
  only for changes that need human review (PR, UI videos, preview, checks,
  review evidence). Withdraw readiness quietly if commits, checks or evidence
  change. A backend merge needs no notification.
- Gilad approves with a new comment that contains `Approved for merge`. It
  authorizes only the version in the latest completed review handoff, and
  only from Gilad's Linear account after that handoff. Delegated agent
  comments, old or quoted comments, praise and unclear links do not count.
- Gilad asks for a revision with a new comment that starts with
  `Changes requested:`. A newer `Changes requested:`, a deleted approval or a
  changed review identity stops the merge. The orchestrator moves the issue
  back to In Progress and delegates the revision in the existing worktree
  and branch. Never interrupt active work for it. Update the same draft PR,
  refresh evidence and repeat the review.
- **Implementation and review agents never post `Approved for merge` or
  `Changes requested:` comments**, even from Gilad's account.
- Before a merge, recheck the commit, base, policy, evidence, review, checks
  and the latest Linear decision. This approval never covers production or
  other repositories.

### Daily merge window (2026-10-20)

- Merges into `staging` happen only in the daily window at 03:00
  America/Los_Angeles, or when Gilad asks for a merge.
- After an approval, the orchestrator does not merge. It moves the issue to
  **Ready to Merge**, adds the `ready-to-merge` label, a PR comment and the
  `agent-review/ready-to-merge` status on the approved head.
- The approval stays valid when only `staging` moves. A new PR commit, a move
  back to draft or a Linear move withdraws it.
- A cloud merger routine runs the window. It merges PRs one at a time and
  requires the approved head. It fixes an out-of-date branch or a conflict
  with one merge commit from `staging`, then needs a full Opus 5.5
  medium-effort re-review of the new head. If a UI PR's visible UI changes
  in that update, it stops and waits for Gilad.
- A PR it cannot fix waits for the next window, with the reason in the PR
  and in Linear.
- After GitHub confirms the merge, move the issue to Done and attach the
  merge commit. The merger never merges into `main` or touches production.
