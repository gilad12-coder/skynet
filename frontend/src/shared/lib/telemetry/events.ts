/**
 * The canonical set of telemetry event names.
 *
 * Centralised so call sites can't drift on spelling and the backend's
 * top-events leaderboard stays legible. Names are short snake_case identifiers
 * (the ingest table caps them at 80 chars). `page_view` and `element_click` are
 * emitted by the autocapture layer; the rest are explicit flow milestones.
 * The server emits `purchase_completed` and `run_completed` / `run_failed` /
 * `run_cancelled` itself (Stripe webhook, worker) — those never fire from here.
