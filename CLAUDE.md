# CLAUDE.md — Skynet

Claude Code reads this file. All project rules are in `AGENTS.md`, which the
next line imports. Read it first, and open the skill or reference file that
its table names when the task needs it.

@AGENTS.md

`.claude/skills/` holds one symlink for each repo skill in `.agents/skills/`,
so Claude Code lists them. When you add a skill, add its link and the
matching `!.claude/skills/<name>` line in `.gitignore`.

Put personal, machine-specific rules (paths, port overrides, sibling
checkouts) in `CLAUDE.local.md`. Devin reads `AGENTS.local.md` for the same
purpose. Both are gitignored; never commit them.
