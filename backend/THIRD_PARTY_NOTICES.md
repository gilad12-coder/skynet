ShinkaEvolve (`shinka-evolve==0.0.7`, Apache-2.0, Copyright Sakana AI) is
installed unmodified from PyPI, with the pinned dependencies in
`core/service_gateway/optimization/blackbox/shinka_requirements.txt`, into its
own virtual environment at `/opt/shinka/venv` only in sandbox images built with
`--build-arg INCLUDE_SHINKA_EVOLVE=1` (off by default, so backend/worker and
air-gap images do not contain it); outside such an image, a run installs it into
a private virtual environment inside the run's sandbox.
When bundled, each package's license text is in its `dist-info` folder. Most are MIT, BSD or
Apache-2.0; certifi and tqdm are MPL-2.0, `Levenshtein` and
`python-Levenshtein` 0.27.5 are GPL-2.0-or-later
(https://github.com/rapidfuzz/Levenshtein/tree/v0.27.5), and `imageio-ffmpeg`
0.6.0 (BSD-2-Clause) carries a static FFmpeg 7.0.2 executable built as GPL-3.0-or-later
(https://github.com/imageio/imageio-ffmpeg/tree/v0.6.0, FFmpeg source: https://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-7.0.2.tar.xz).

## LGPL Python dependencies

These are installed unmodified as separate packages and may be replaced with
any compatible version. Their license texts are in their `dist-info` folders.
