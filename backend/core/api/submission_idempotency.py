    A budgetless older client cannot tell the server whether a repeated request
    is intentional or an uncertain transport retry. Its typed request therefore
    receives a content-addressed identity. Semantically identical legacy
    requests replay the first accepted job until the caller supplies an explicit
    key or changes an input. Only the digest is returned; raw credentials and
    authored payload content never enter the key or logs.

    Args:
        payload: Typed request before budget, setup evidence, or seed mutation.
        username: Authenticated account owning the request and replay scope.
        workflow: DSPy or Anything request family.
        supplied_key: Optional caller-provided ``Idempotency-Key`` header.

    Returns:
        Keys for account-scoped job lookup/persistence and budget creation.
