"""Read a repository run's files at its pinned commit. [INTERNAL]

Frontend-only (hidden from public docs):
- ``GET /optimizations/{id}/repository/tree`` — every file and folder at the commit.
- ``GET /optimizations/{id}/repository/file`` — one file's text at the commit.
- ``POST /optimizations/{id}/repository/archive`` — the whole repository with one version applied, as a zip.

Every version of a repository run is a patch against one pinned commit; the
run page applies the patches itself and only needs the base tree and files.
GitHub is read with the run owner's connection, since the commit belongs to
the run rather than to whoever is viewing it, and anonymously when the owner
has none, so public repositories still open.
