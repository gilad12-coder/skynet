"""First-party product-telemetry ingestion and admin read endpoints.

The browser SDK batches interaction events (page views, labelled clicks, named
flow events) to ``POST /telemetry/events`` — a public endpoint that accepts both
authenticated and anonymous callers, so pre-login activity is captured too. The
caller's identity is taken from the request's auth token, never the request
body: an anonymous batch lands with ``username = None`` and is attributed only
by the SDK's opaque ``anonymous_id``. The admin-only read endpoints aggregate
the table into the "how is Skynet actually used" figures.
