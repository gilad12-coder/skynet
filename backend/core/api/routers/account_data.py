"""Self-service account data export and irreversible account deletion. [INTERNAL]

Backs the GDPR/CCPA "download my data" and "delete my account" controls in
Settings. Both routes are bearer-authenticated and act only on the caller's own
identity (``user.username`` — the lowercased email every table keys on).
Deletion hard-removes the account's own content and secrets and anonymizes the
financial and audit records retention law requires be kept; it makes no live
call to Stripe or any other provider (see :mod:`core.api.account_data_service`).
