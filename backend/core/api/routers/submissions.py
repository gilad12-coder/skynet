"""Routes for submitting optimization jobs. [PUBLIC DEV API]

``POST /run`` — single optimization run.
``POST /grid-search`` — sweep over (generation, reflection) model pairs.
``POST /blackbox/run`` — black-box text optimization against a scorer.
``POST /blackbox/scorer/dry-run`` — score one version before submitting.

``/run`` and ``/grid-search`` are part of the public dev surface and are
listed in ``_SCALAR_PUBLIC_PATHS`` (see ``backend/core/api/app.py``); the
black-box routes join it once the contract settles.
