"""Routes for submitting optimization jobs. [PUBLIC DEV API]

``POST /optimize`` — one optimization run of a prompt, code, text or DSPy
program, for every optimizer.
``POST /blackbox/run`` — one optimization of a GitHub repository.
``GET /optimizers`` — the optimizers that fit a setup, with availability.
``GET /blackbox/engines`` — the engine catalog with per-deployment availability.

Stored grid-search, DSPy and legacy black-box runs stay readable; the worker
still executes legacy payloads already queued or resumed.
