"""Hosted remote MCP server: agents run optimizations on a Skynet account (SKY-229).

The server speaks stateless Streamable HTTP at the configured resource URL
(:attr:`core.config.Settings.mcp_resource_url`), for example
``https://mcp.skynetml.com/mcp``. A PR preview serves it under its API host at
``/remote-mcp``, so it never collides with the internal ``/mcp`` mount.

Every request needs an MCP OAuth access token (:mod:`core.api.mcp_oauth`). A
missing or refused token gets a 401 with an RFC 9728 ``WWW-Authenticate``
challenge, so the client can discover the authorization server.

The tools call the same service layer as ``POST /optimize`` and the
optimization routes. A run always gets a new execution budget with the
agent's ``max_cost_cents``, with the same reservation and billing as a run
from the UI. There are no tools that move money.
