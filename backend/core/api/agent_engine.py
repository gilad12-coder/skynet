"""The per-user agent engine: which engine runs an agent turn that picks no model.

Hosted mode always runs on OpenRouter, so it never reads the stored setting.
Local mode runs agent turns on the engine the user chose: a subscription CLI,
or OpenRouter with the user's verified key. With no choice, it runs them on the
first CLI that is ready on this machine, else on the user's verified OpenRouter
key. A CLI engine never falls back to OpenRouter. In local mode an
optimization proposer with no CLI pick follows the same engine CLI.
