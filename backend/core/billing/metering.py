"""Per-run LLM usage metering for the interactive surfaces.

Optimization jobs already debit through the worker at completion; this module
gives the interactive surfaces — agent turns, interview turns, tagging
predictions — the same seam. A surface hands over the ``MeteredLM`` objects a
run used; the helper harvests their per-model token usage, prices it, and
writes the debit (with measured token counts stamped on the ledger row), all
best-effort: a metering failure never breaks the user-facing turn. It is not
free either — a failed debit is logged at ``ERROR`` (which the alert handler
forwards) and retried as a conservative charge at the fallback frontier price
for the tokens that were measured.
