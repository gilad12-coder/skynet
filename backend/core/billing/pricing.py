"""Per-model, per-token run pricing — the shared basis for estimate and charge.

A run's credit cost is the real provider cost of its tokens (LiteLLM's
``model_cost`` registry, input and output priced separately) times the platform
:data:`MARKUP`, converted to credits at :data:`CREDIT_USD_VALUE`. The *same*
function prices a projected token volume (the pre-run estimate) and a measured
token volume (the post-run charge), so the two reconcile by construction — only
their inputs differ.

Model choice moves a run's price, and :data:`MARKUP` is the single re-priceable
margin lever (mirrored by the frontend estimate) — currently 1.35: payment fees,
a small infra share, and a modest profit margin on top, so the platform covers
the CPU and storage behind a run and earns a little while volume is low. The
module is a leaf — it depends
only on LiteLLM's static price table — so both the billing service and any
estimator can import it without cycles.
