"""Parent side of a host-CLI proposer turn, run on the user's own subscription.

In local mode a black-box proposer can be the user's own coding CLI (Codex
or Claude Code). The sandbox never reaches the CLI itself. Its shim
(:mod:`core.worker.host_agent_shim`) sends the workspace to the gateway's
``/v1/_host_agent`` capability. This module unpacks that archive into a fresh
copy under ``local_state_dir``, runs the CLI there with provider API keys
removed from its environment, and sends the edited tree back. The CLI never
runs in the user's original folder.

The guest is untrusted. The CLI and its permission come only from the run's
stored proposer settings, given to :func:`bind_host_agent` by the worker, and
only the token minted for that proposer reaches the capability. Agent config
in the copy (``.claude/``, ``.codex/``, ``.factory/``, MCP files) is removed
before the CLI starts, and a ``workspace_only`` turn runs under a macOS
``sandbox-exec`` profile that denies reads and writes in the user's home
except the turn's own directory and the CLI's install paths. A codex turn's
login copy holds only placeholders; its model calls go through a per-turn
loopback proxy (:mod:`core.billing.codex_auth_proxy`) that adds the real token.

The turn is recorded in the run's budget at zero cost: the user's
subscription pays, not the wallet.
