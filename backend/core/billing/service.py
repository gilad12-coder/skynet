"""Stripe-backed billing service: customers, checkout, portal, and webhooks.

This module is the only place that talks to Stripe. The web app calls the
billing router, which delegates here. Stripe is the source of truth for money
(pack charges); the local ``billing_customers`` / ``wallet_ledger`` tables are
a synced cache plus an audit trail, reconciled by
:meth:`StripeBillingService.handle_webhook` on every event Stripe delivers.

Ledger reads work whether or not Stripe is configured, so a deploy without
keys degrades to a read-only free tier. Stripe profile/history reads report
the provider as unavailable, while mutations (checkout and portal) require
``settings.is_stripe_configured`` and raise
``DomainError("billing.not_configured", 503)`` otherwise — never a 500.

        :meth:`get_wallet` reports spendable cents (grant then paid). A **managed**

        Skynet's platform fee (:func:`run_cost_cents`), since the provider tokens

        returns the first charge, so a redelivered or re-run leg never
        double-charges. A run costing zero cents writes nothing.

        The debit can never drive the account negative: the customer row is read

        row (a zero-delta row when nothing could be collected), logged, and sent

        the platform is out of pocket for the tokens they bought: the remainder
        is taken from the free grant (which then cannot be spent on top of the
        reversed money) and whatever is still owed becomes ``debt_cents``.
        Both balances are then zero, so every spend gate refuses until a top-up
        repays the debt (:meth:`_on_checkout_completed`). The ledger row records
        the collected delta and the debt as ``uncollected_cents`` — a zero-delta
        row when nothing was collected — so :meth:`_pi_clawback_context` counts the
        full reversal and a later event cannot claw it twice. A debt is logged and
        sent as an operator alert.

        Args:
            session: Open session (caller commits).
            event_id: Stripe event id, recorded on the ledger row.
            payment_intent: The PaymentIntent id, stamped on the ledger row so a
                later clawback nets against it.
            username: Account to draw the cents back from.
            cents: Cents owed back to Stripe (positive).
            kind: Ledger kind (``"refund"`` or ``"dispute"``).
            description: Human label for the ledger row.
