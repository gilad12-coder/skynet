"""Stripe-backed billing service: customers, checkout, subscriptions, webhooks.

This module is the only place that talks to Stripe. The web app calls the
billing router, which delegates here. Stripe is the source of truth for money
(charges and subscription state); the local ``billing_customers`` /
``credit_ledger`` tables are a synced cache plus an audit trail, reconciled by
:meth:`StripeBillingService.handle_webhook` on every event Stripe delivers.

Reads (the wallet) work whether or not Stripe is configured, so a deploy
without keys degrades to a read-only free tier. Mutations (checkout, subscribe,
portal) require ``settings.is_stripe_configured`` and raise
``DomainError("billing.not_configured", 503)`` otherwise — never a 500.
