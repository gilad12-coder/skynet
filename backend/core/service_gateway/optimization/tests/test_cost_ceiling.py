"""Tests for the per-job cost ceiling callback.

The callback re-prices accumulated per-model LM usage after each call and
hard-stops the run once its full per-model credit cost exceeds the cap. These
exercise the trip boundary, the no-ceiling inert case, multi-LM totalling, and
the latch — with budgets set relative to the pricing engine so the assertions
don't hinge on exact per-token arithmetic.
