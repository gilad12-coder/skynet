"""A bounded, redacted live transcript of one sandboxed contract check.

The Check on the Metric & run screen was three silent rows for tens of
seconds. While it runs, every sandboxed command — install, then one harness
run per sample — passes through :func:`sandbox_log.logged_command`, which
mirrors it here: the command line, its scrubbed output as it streams, and how
it ended, pinned to the Check row (phase) it belongs to and, inside the
evaluator, to the sample it serves. The API route streams each event over SSE
as it happens and the snapshot is stored in the check's preflight evidence, so
a finished, failed or deduplicated check replays the same transcript without
running again.

The transcript is untrusted text on its way to a browser, so every line passes
the command's own :class:`sandbox_log.Scrubber` (every environment value the
command saw) and then the recorder's (provider keys and the scoped gateway
token, which reach the box only encoded inside the harness's init message).
Harness plumbing never appears: reply frames are dropped and scorer ``log()``
frames are shown as their message alone. Each line, each phase and the
transcript as a whole have a budget, and a phase that spends its own is
marked truncated rather than silently cut.
