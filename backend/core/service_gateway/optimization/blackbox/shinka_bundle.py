"""Evolve a repository with ShinkaEvolve as a bundle of the files a version changes.

Upstream evolves one program text. For a repository target that text is a
bundle: the full contents of every file the version changes relative to the
run's starting commit, each after a line naming its repository path. The
model never edits the bundle itself; it sees the repository's file list, the
files the current version changes and the files the scorer's feedback
mentions, may ask to open more files, and answers with one ``FILE`` block per
file (SEARCH/REPLACE edits or full contents). Novelty is measured on the
changes alone, and scoring materializes a bundle into the checkout and hands
the parent the same ``git diff`` every other repository engine produces.

Stdlib plus ``repo_tree``: it ships into the sandbox beside the runner.
