"""Copy what a sandboxed command writes to stderr into the run log.

A sandbox, and every file in it, is gone once the run ends, so its stderr is
the only record of why something inside it failed. Every session's ``run`` goes
through :func:`logged_command`: stderr lines stream to :data:`stream_logger` at
DEBUG while the command runs, and a command that fails, times out or raises
logs a WARNING with its last lines on :data:`logger`. Each record carries the
sandbox's job as ``sandbox_owner``; the worker routes records by it into that
job's run log, and the optimization subprocess forwards them as log events.

Sandbox output is untrusted, so it is stripped of terminal control sequences
and scrubbed of every secret the command was given. :func:`forward` relays a
structured record a sandbox sent, attributed and capped by the host. Inside an
:func:`event_scope`, the ``log()`` events a scorer writes to stderr are relayed
the same way, pinned to the scope's source, candidate and case. A multi-line
message, such as a stack trace or a printed error object, becomes one row.
