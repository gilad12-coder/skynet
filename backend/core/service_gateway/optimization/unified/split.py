"""Split a unified run's cases into train, validation and test, server side.

This is the one place the held-out split is decided. Engines receive the
train cases and the validation cases; selection (the winner and the
regression guard) runs on validation, falling back to train when there is
none; the reported scores are measured on test, falling back to validation.
Test cases never reach an engine, a proposer or the contract check.
