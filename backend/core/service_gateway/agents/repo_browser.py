"""Read-only view of a GitHub repository for the black-box authoring agent.

The wizard's agent sees a repository job's structure as a compact,
hierarchical tree (folders collapse to file counts past a depth or line
budget) and opens what it needs through two ReAct tools: one expands a
folder, the other reads a file. Every call goes to GitHub with the caller's
own token, so the agent can only see what the caller can.
