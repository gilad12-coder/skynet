"""Deliver messages a user sends into an agent turn that is still running.

A steerable turn request carries a client-chosen ``steer_key``. While the turn
streams, the chat posts follow-up messages under that key; the running loop
takes them at its next step boundary and appends them to its history as a new
user message, so the model reads them before its next decision. When the turn
ends, the client withdraws whatever the loop never read and sends it as the
next turn.

Messages live in the shared database because the steer POST and the streaming
turn can land on different backend replicas. Without an engine (tests, local
runs without Postgres) an in-process store stands in.
