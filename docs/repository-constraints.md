# Repository constraints: `optimize.toml`

A repository run reads an `optimize.toml` file at the root of the repository,
at the pinned commit. The file can only narrow the settings that the run's
owner approved. It cannot widen them, and it cannot grant services.

```toml
version = 1

[paths]
# Optional. Each path must be inside an approved editable path.
editable = ["bot/geocode"]
# Optional. No version may change these, even inside an editable path.
protected = ["bot/geocode/eval", "data/labels.csv"]

[setup]
# Optional. Used only when the run has no setup command of its own.
command = "pip install -r requirements.txt"

[instructions]
# Optional. The optimization agent reads these as guidance. They are not enforced.
intent = "Return the coordinates of the place the sender most likely means."
invariants = ["Keep the reply format unchanged."]

[rules]
# Optional. Plain-language illegal approaches. Judge models enforce them.
illegal = [
  "Do not hardcode answers for dataset cases.",
  "Do not call an outside geocoding service.",
]
```

## What is enforced

| Setting | Enforcement |
| --- | --- |
| `[paths] editable` | The parent checks every version before it is scored or published. A path outside the approved editable paths fails the setup check. |
| `[paths] protected` | The parent rejects a version that changes a protected path, in its patch or while its code runs. A write that the code undoes before it exits also counts. The rejection names the path and the rule, with secret values hidden. `optimize.toml` itself is always protected. |
| `[setup] command` | Runs once on the starting commit, with package-registry network and no secrets. The box goes offline before any version runs. |
| `[instructions]` | Not enforced. The agent reads them in its brief. The scorer decides the score. |
| `[rules] illegal` | Enforced by judge models. See "Plain-language rules" below. |

## What fails the setup check

- A `[services]` section. Repository runs cannot reach outside services yet,
  and a repository file can never grant them.
- An unknown section or setting, a `version` other than `1`, or invalid TOML.
- A path that leaves the repository, names `.git`, or protects the whole tree.
- A path with `*`, `?` or `[`. Paths are literal; patterns are not supported,
  so name the files or folders.
- An empty `[paths] editable` list, or protected paths that cover every
  editable path. Such a run could not change anything. This includes a run
  without the file whose only approved editable path is `optimize.toml`,
  because `optimize.toml` is always protected.
- An `optimize.toml` that is a link or a folder, or a file larger than 64 KiB.

## Where the effective environment is recorded

The setup check response includes `environment`. The run saves the same
record under `target.repo.environment`. It holds the commit, the editable,
protected and read-only paths, the secret names (never values), the setup
command, the network for setup and for versions, and the services (none).
A resumed run that arrives at different rules fails instead of continuing.

## Plain-language rules

`[rules] illegal` lists up to 50 rules, each up to 500 characters. The
agent's brief lists every rule at the start as "Rule 1", "Rule 2" and so on.
Skynet enforces them in three places:

1. **Blocked versions.** When the path rules refuse a version, the agent gets
   this text and continues: "Illegal action. Read the constraints file. You
   cannot do this action. Do not repeat it, because it wastes time." This is
   the same for the parent's check and for the sandbox's early checks:
   AutoResearch `eval.sh`, Meta-Harness `save.sh` and its candidate check, the
   AutoSaddler verifier, and the ShinkaEvolve file-edit check (model and agent
   editors). A blocked version uses no scoring budget.
2. **Judge during the run.** About every 15 agent actions, a fast judge model
   reads the recent actions and the current diff against the rules. When it
   sees work that goes toward a violation, the agent's next scoring reply
   carries this note: "Check the constraints file. You are probably about to
   violate rule X." The agent may continue.
3. **Judge on each version.** Before the scorer runs, a stronger judge reads
   the full diff of the version. When the diff breaks a rule, the version is
   an "illegal approach": it gets a score of 0 and the judge's reason as its
   feedback, and the scorer does not run. The version stays in the run
   history with its score of 0, so later versions can learn from it. This is
   the same for every optimizer.

Each block, note and rejection is a run-log event (`rule.block`,
`rule.note`, `rule.rejection`) that names the rule and the reason. The run's
Logs tab shows them. A block from the parent has the source `host`. A block
from a sandbox check has the source `engine`. The judges read only the rules, the agent's actions and
the diff. They never read the scorer's data or the test labels. Their model
calls go through the run's metered model gateway on the managed key, so the
run budget pays for them. Only the parent can call the judge routes.

The judge models default to the model catalog's best-value model (fast
judge) and strongest model (final judge). Operators can set
`RULE_WATCH_MODEL` and `RULE_JUDGE_MODEL` to override them. When a file has
rules but the server has no managed model key, the setup check fails. When
the final judge cannot give a clear answer, or a diff is longer than 400,000
characters, the version gets a scoring error. It is not marked illegal.

Limits:

- A Meta-Harness `save.sh` block reaches the run log when the agent's
  session turn ends, not at the moment of the block.
- A ShinkaEvolve agent-editor block also arrives when the agent's session
  ends. The whole version is refused, and the block text is the version's
  error, which ShinkaEvolve keeps as the failed attempt's message.
- Without a constraints file, the ShinkaEvolve agent editor still drops
  changes outside the editable paths without a message, as before.
- Without a constraints file, the sandbox checks keep their earlier messages,
  which name the refused paths, and they write no `rule.block` event.
- The fast judge counts each answered model call of the agent as one action.
  Its note arrives with the next scoring reply, not in the middle of a turn.
- A version with no changes (the starting point) is not judged.
